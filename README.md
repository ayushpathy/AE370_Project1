AE370 Project 1 – Group 28

Numerical Simulation of Predator-Prey Dynamics:

This project explores the behavior of a nonlinear predator-prey system using numerical methods. Specifically, we analyze how the populations of two interacting species evolve over time according to the Lotka–Volterra equations, a classic model in dynamical systems.

Through simulation and visualization, we study the effects of different initial conditions and parameter values on the system’s long-term behavior, such as oscillations, equilibrium, or collapse. The project emphasizes the importance of numerical techniques in solving systems of coupled ordinary differential equations and demonstrates how these methods can be applied to real-world modeling scenarios in ecology and engineering. This work was completed as part of AE370 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and connects directly to the course’s focus on initial value problems and numerical integration.
