Overview
This project investigates the behavior of a nonlinear predator-prey system governed by the classical Lotkaâ€“Volterra equations, a fundamental example of coupled first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These equations model the interaction between a prey population and a predator population over time. The primary objective of this project is to numerically solve the system using the Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4) method and to evaluate the accuracy, stability, and long-term behavior of the solutions under varying conditions.

This work is directly connected to core topics covered in AE370, particularly the numerical solution of initial value problems (IVPs) for ODEs. The project emphasizes the practical application of numerical time-stepping methods to simulate dynamical systems in engineering.
